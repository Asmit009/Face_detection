# Face_detection
1.) The model detects the faces in an image.<br>
2.) The model is made using a haar cascade file.<br>
3.) The model uses OpenCV for image processing and image detection.<br>
4.) The model is not very accurate and needs to be enhanced further for more noisy images although it gives accurate results for less noisy images.<br>
